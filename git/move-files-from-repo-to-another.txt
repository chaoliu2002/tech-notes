# 1. clone the source 

git clone ssh://<user>@<source-repo url> 

cd <source-repo> 

# 2. remove the stuff we want to exclude 

git filter-branch --tree-filter "rm -rf <files to exclude>" --prune-empty HEAD 

# 3. move to target repo and create a merge branch (for safety) 

cd <path to target-repo> 

git checkout -b <merge branch> 

# 4. Add the source-repo as remoteâ€¯ 

git remote add source-repo <path to source-repo> 

# 5. fetch it 

git pull source-repo master 

# 6. check that you got it right (better safe than sorry, right?)
